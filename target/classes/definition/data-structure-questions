Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A. We need data structure to store organizing information.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
A. Insertion
   Deletion
   Traversal
   Merging
   Sorting
   Searching

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
A. 1. Compiler Design
   2. Operating System
   3. Database Management System
   4. Statistical Analysis Package
   5. Numerical Analysis
   6. Graphics
   7. Artificial Intelligence
   8. Simulation
what is an Array?
A. An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
A. The difference between the Array and ArrayList is an Array is fixed in size while an ArrayList is dynamically growing.

what is LinkedList?
A. A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
A. In array, each element is independent, no connection with previous element or with its location. In Linked list,
   location or address of elements is stored in the link part of previous element/nod
what is queue?
A. A queue is designed to have elements inserted at the end of the queue,
   and elements removed from the beginning of the queue.

what is stack?
A. Stack is a collection that is based on the last in first out (LIFO) principle.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
A. FIFO is First in first out and LIFO last in first out.

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
A. The best case to search an element from an array is Sequential search when trying to find a value in an unsorted array.

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
A. The worst case to search an element from an array is when the search item appears at the end of the list or not at all.

what is tree in data structure?
A. Tree in data structure is a non-linear data structure where data objects are organized in terms of hierarchical relationship.

what is graph in data structure?
A. A graph in data structure is an object consisting of a vertex set and edge set.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
A. The difference between the HashTable and HashMap is HashTable is synchronized whereas hashmap is not.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
A. RDBMS uses Arrays (Array of structures).
   Network data model uses Graph.
   Hierarchical data model uses Trees.

How HashMap works in java?
A. HashMap uses multiple buckets and each bucket points to a singly linked list where the entries (nodes) are stored. Once
   the bucket is identified by the hash function using hashcode, then hashcode is used to check if there is already a key
   with the same hashcode or not in the bucket(singly linked list).

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
A.  ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java is Thrown to indicate that an Array has been accessed with an illegal index. It
    occurs when we access an array, or a collection, that is backed by an invalid index.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
A. The different ways of copying an array into another array is manually, use a for loop and copy elements of one to another one
   by one or System.arraycopy()

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
A. The difference between an array and a linked list is in a array each element is independent, no connection with previous element
   or with its location. In Linked list,location or address of elements is stored in the link part of previous element/node.

What is DFS and BFS?
A. The breadth first search (BFS) and the depth first search (DFS) are the two algorithms used for traversing and searching a node
   in a graph.

What is Recursion?
A. A method that calls itself.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
A.  In a linear data structure, data elements are arranged in a linear order where each and every element is attached to its previous
    and next adjacent. In a non-linear data structure, data elements are attached in hierarchically manner.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
A. Big O notation is used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
A.  1.Selection sort
    2.Merge sort
    3.Heapsort
    4.Quicksort
    5.Bubble sort
    6.Shellsort
    7.Comb sort

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
